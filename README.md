## Overview of the project


### Project: craft a user-friendly to-do list web app with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

### Objective:  
The goal of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will allow users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them from the list, providing an intuitive way to manage daily tasks.  

### Key Features:

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks using an input field and an "Add" button or by pressing the Enter key.  
- **Complete Task:** Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, visually indicating completed tasks with a line-through style.  
- **Remove Task:** Each task includes a "Remove" button that allows users to delete the task from the list.  
##Technologies Used:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the to-do list app, including input fields, buttons, and a list to display tasks.
- **CSS:** Styles the app to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS is used to style the input fields, buttons, and list items, as well as to indicate completed tasks.
- **JavaScript:** Handles user interactions such as adding, completing, and removing tasks. JavaScript also updates the DOM dynamically based on user actions.
### Implementation Steps:

-**Set Up HTML Structure:** Create the basic structure of the app with input fields for adding tasks, a button to add tasks, and an unordered list to display tasks.
-**Style the App with CSS:** Apply styles to ensure the app looks clean and user-friendly. This includes styling the container, input fields, buttons, and task list items.
**Implement JavaScript Functionality:**  
- **Add Task:** Capture user input from the text field and add it to the task list when the "Add" button is clicked or the Enter key is pressed.
- **Complete Task:** Add a click event to each task that toggles its completion status, visually indicating completed tasks with a line-through style.
- **Remove Task:** Add a "Remove" button to each task that allows users to delete the task from the list.
###User Flow:

-The user enters a task in the input field.
-The user clicks the "Add" button or presses the Enter key to add the task to the list.
-The task appears in the list with a "Remove" button next to it.
-The user can click on the task to mark it as complete, which adds a line-through style.
-The user can click the "Remove" button to delete the task from the list.
###Conclusion:
- This project provides a basic yet functional to-do list web application. It demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, offering a practical example of how these technologies work together to create a dynamic web app.
